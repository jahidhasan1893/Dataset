You are given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n. Your task is to calculate the number of arrays of n positive integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n such that: 

  * 1 ≤ b_i ≤ a_i for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), and 
  * b_i ≠ b_{i+1} for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1). 



The number of such arrays can be very large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print the answer modulo 998 244 353 in a single line.

Note

In the first test case possible arrays are [1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 2].

In the second test case possible arrays are [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 1] and [2, 3].
