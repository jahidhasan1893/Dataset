XYMXYM and CQXYM will prepare n problems for Codeforces. The difficulty of the problem i will be an integer a_i, where a_i ≥ 0. The difficulty of the problems must satisfy a_i+a_{i+1}<m (1 ≤ i < n), and a_1+a_n<m, where m is a fixed integer. XYMXYM wants to know how many plans of the difficulty of the problems there are modulo 998 244 353.

Two plans of difficulty a and b are different only if there is an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) satisfying a_i ≠ b_i.

Input

A single line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 50 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print a single integer — the number of different plans.

Note

In the first test case, the valid a are: [0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,0], [1,0,0].

[1,0,1] is invalid since a_1+a_n ≥ m.
