Kuzya started going to school. He was given math homework in which he was given an array a of length n and an array of symbols b of length n, consisting of symbols '*' and '/'.

Let's denote a path of calculations for a segment [l; r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) in the following way: 

  * Let x=1 initially. For every i from l to r we will consequently do the following: if b_i= '*', x=x*a_i, and if b_i= '/', then x=(x)/(a_i). Let's call a path of calculations for the segment [l; r] a list of all x that we got during the calculations (the number of them is exactly r - l + 1). 



For example, let a=[7, 12, 3, 5, 4, 10, 9], b=[/, *, /, /, /, *, *], l=2, r=6, then the path of calculations for that segment is [12, 4, 0.8, 0.2, 2].

Let's call a segment [l;r] simple if the path of calculations for it contains only integer numbers. 

Kuzya needs to find the number of simple segments [l;r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n). Since he obviously has no time and no interest to do the calculations for each option, he asked you to write a program to get to find that number!

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).

The third line contains n symbols without spaces between them — the array b_1, b_2 … b_n (b_i= '/' or b_i= '*' for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n).

Output

Print a single integer — the number of simple segments [l;r].
